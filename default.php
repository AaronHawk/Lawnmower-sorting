"The mower stalled, twice; kneeling, I found <br>
A hedgehog jammed up against the blades,   <br>
Killed. It had been in the long grass. <br><br>

I had seen it before, and even fed it, once.   <br>
Now I had mauled its unobtrusive world   <br>
Unmendably. Burial was no help:<br>
<br>
Next morning I got up and it did not. <br>
The first day after a death, the new absence   <br>
Is always the same; we should be careful<br>
<br>
Of each other, we should be kind   <br>
While there is still time. " <br>
-Philip Larkin, "The Mower" from Collected Poems
